<h2>pricing</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Heads up: we've spent a week hemming and hawing on pricing. In order to
sustain continued operation, maintenance, and capital outlay, we've settled
on this pricing model. We are comfortable with it.
</p>
<p>
Once you are enrolled in our invoicing system and pay your first payment,
<b>*that is your rate*</b>.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>storage + bandwidth + colocation:</h2>
<p>Each plan includes 1 TB of bandwidth (data movement) per month.</p>
<p>
<u>We do not distinguish between upload and download.</u>
1 TB is 1 TB, whether you send or receive.
</p>
<p>
For additional bandwidth, we charge $5/TB. Bandwidth purchases do
not expire. For example, you can top-up your account with 10 TB and use
it slowly over the course of a year. Or, you can purchase 1 TB whenever you
run out.
</p>
<p>
Your account has two quotas: "base bandwidth" and "additional bandwidth".
Your "base bandwidth" resets to 1 TB on the 1st of each month. Your
"additional bandwidth" is only consumed when your "base bandwidth" has run
out.

<p>
The <u>service cost</u> covers electricity, colocation, 1x IPv4 address, and
1 TB "base bandwidth" (data movement).
</p>

<h2>vps instance details:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 GB of RAM</li> 
    <li>25 GB of NVMe storage (for the OS install)</li>
    <li>1x IPv4 address</li>
    <li>1x subdomain at zfs.rent, e.g. "marvin.zfs.rent"</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A positive benefit of the rent-to-own model, is that all wear and tear
  (excessive reads/writes) is caused by a single user -- as opposed
  to a shared drive.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to create a RAIDZ or Mirror ZPool, please purchase multiple
  drives. <u>Data redundancy is up to you.</u>
</p>

<h2>bandwidth:</h2>
<p>
All plans include 1 TB (combined upload/download). Each additional TB
of data movement costs $5.00/TB.
</p>
<p>
Uplink and downlink speeds are guaranteed to be >= 100 mbps. Most of the time,
expect >= 750 mbps.
