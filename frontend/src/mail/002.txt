zfs.rent // update #002

December 2nd, 2020

Hello all,
We wanted to send out a quick update on our progress:

  * After hitting over 200 inquiries, we are no longer fielding new beta users.
    Each and every inquiry has been responded to personally 
  * We were supposed to deploy our low-cost trial machines on Monday, but there
    was a scheduling miscommunication with the datacenter. No worries. We're
    driving down today for installation. Once that system is deployed, the
    management portal will go online with it. If you do not know your position
    in the beta queue already, you can view it after logging in.
  * If you start with the low-cost trial plan (https://zfs.rent/pricing.html),
    you can always transfer your plan to a /rent/, /rent-to-own/, or
    /bring-your-own/ plan and *preserve your VPS's boot drive.*
  * We are now rolling out two 30x drive-chassis per week -- but if everything
    goes well, we might place a bulk order for new systems to fulfill everyone
    in the queue at once.
  * In the next update, we will post some photos of the datacenter and drive
    hypervisors in action.
  * (Also, we hate mailing lists with hard-to-find unsubscribe links. Ours will
    always be front-and-center at the top.)
  * To our great relief, most users have decided to commit to a bring-your-own
    plan, which significantly reduces our capital outlay. If you are currently
    on a rent or rent-to-own plan, that's okay too! Our pricing model can
    sustain this for a large userbase now.

Cheers,
Ryan
