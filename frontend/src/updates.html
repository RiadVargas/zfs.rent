<h4>Open-Source</h4>
<p>
We went open-source.
</p>

<h4>API</h4>
<p>
As we mentioned in our
<a href="https://radious.co/philosophy.txt">philosophy.txt</a>
document, we strive for an API-first system. Everything exposed on our
dashboards can be called directly over HTTP/JSON APIs. There are two API
namespaces: <code>/v1/public/</code> and <code>/v1/user/</code>. These are
documented <a href="https://github.com/radious-subsystems/zfs.rent/tree/master/docs">on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h4>Accounts</h4>
<p>
decided to go with email auth

<h4>Roadblocks</h4>
<p>
Here are a few roadblocks we have encountered over the past two weeks.
</p>
<hr>

<h4>Hardware Issue #1 - Temperature</h4>
<p>
Shortly after launch, we assembled a 2x 8TB system in a small 1U chassis
to benchmark disk speeds and log temperatures within the datacenter.
Unfortunately, cooling was an issue. We did not install any fans directed at
the drives. (Note: "m2_drive" refers to "machine-2", not the M.2 device
standard.) The cyclical spikes you are seeing correspond to the datacenter's
ambient temperature day/night cycle.

<p>
Eh... I thought this ER diagram generator made the DB schema look slick, so
I'd might as well post it. All of our base entities are tracked in the database.
It records their power usage, bandwidth consumption, temperature, etc.

<p>
I'm going to port over a project that I've been working on to plot lightweight
.png graphs of the systems.

Look ma! No JS!

<p>
(Axes labels will be added to the zfs.rent graphs of course.)
